            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Leyan Tang, a fourth-year student who transferred to UVA during the second year at school. I use she/her pronouns. I'm interested in pursuing a PhD degree upon my graduation, which is rare for Commerce students, but I'm enthusiastic about applying large-scale AI/ML techniques to the world of business. Welcome to my little corner of the Internet!</p>
            <h2>Major & Concentrations</h2>
            <p>Commerce Major with Finance and IT concentrations (Business Analytics track)</p>
            <h2>Hometown</h2>
            <p>I originate from Yangzhou, China, a true gem nestled in the embrace of Jiangsu Province. This picturesque city is a harmonious blend of natural beauty and historical richness. </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I like singing (used to be a vocalist in a school band), swimming, hiking, pop jazz dancing (got my top-level certificate for amateur dancers in China) and cooking. </p>
